# Tea Time SSL
## My attempt at solid state logic and a general playground for my Audio Plugin Shenanigans

### **WARNING:** This Readme is much more like a journal, stream of consciousness type joint. I am not a relable author and possibly a bad friend.

### Specs
* Originally Built In VS 2019 (Hence the VS Solutions)
* I don't use Mac so don't expect any of the things to work with it

### Current Algorithms
* Amp Envelope

### Builds - Each branch is a different framework/build of the SSL
* ***Stolen***: Made with some base classes I stole from a Audio Design book repo. I'd post credits but methinks if they ever saw the butchery that I did to their code it would bring only dishonor to my clan.

* ***JUCE***: I hate coding front end junk, so most of what I'm using JUCE for here is the audio buffer. Also this SSL is more for my own learning, so using their DSP algorithms would be cheating. If I ever decide to make this pretty it'll be with some tool that let's me make UI without any real code heavy lifting

* *More Soon (Or not IDGAF)*
