# Tea Time SSL
## I mashed my name with SSL so it seems like I got my own suite of high end plug ins. Hah, 'high end'. good one mate.

### **WARNING:** This Readme is much more like a journal, stream of consciousness type joint. I am not a reliable author and possibly a bad friend.

### Specs
* Originally Built In VS 2019 (Hence the VS Solutions)
* I don't use Mac so don't expect any of the things to work with it

### Current Algorithms
* Amp Envelope (a bad one! Ha!)
* Auto Panner

### Builds - Each branch is a different framework/build of the SSL
* ***Stolen***: Made with some base classes I stole from a Audio Design book repo. I'd post credits but methinks if they ever saw the butchery that I did to their code it would bring only dishonor to my clan.

* ***JUCE***: I know I need to learn how to make GUI interfaces, but for now JUCE is nice for GIU and the buffer. All the DSP is hand made because if I ever want to have my own codebase for homebrew plugins it would involve me writing my own GUI and buffer.
